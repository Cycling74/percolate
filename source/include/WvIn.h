/*! \class WvIn
    \brief STK audio data input base class.

    This class provides input support for various
    audio file formats.  It also serves as a base
    class for "realtime" streaming subclasses.

    WvIn loads the contents of an audio file for
    subsequent output.  Linear interpolation is
    used for fractional "read rates".

    WvIn supports multi-channel data in
    interleaved format.  It is important to
    distinguish the tick() methods, which return
    samples produced by averaging across sample
    frames, from the tickFrame() methods, which
    return pointers to multi-channel sample
    frames.  For single-channel data, these
    methods return equivalent values.

    Small files are completely read into local
    memory during instantiation.  Large files are
    read incrementally from disk.  The file size
    threshold and the increment size values are
    defined in WvIn.h.

    When the end of a file is reached, subsequent
    calls to the tick() functions return the data
    values at the end of the file.

    WvIn currently supports WAV, AIFF, SND (AU),
    MAT-file (Matlab), and STK RAW file formats.
    Signed integer (8-, 16-, and 32-bit) and floating-
    point (32- and 64-bit) data types are supported.
    Compressed data types are not supported.  If using
    MAT-files, data should be saved in an array with
    each data channel filling a matrix row.  The sample
    rate for MAT-files is assumed to be 44100 Hz.
