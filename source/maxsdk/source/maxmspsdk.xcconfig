// The following section sets the Mac SDK version to be used.
// For most projects this has little to no impact because there are no direct dependencies on OS function calls.
// In those projects with OS function calls, it should be okay to use the most recent SDK version because the 
// MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET will disable functionality that is unavailable in the older target OS.
// For this reason, the SDKROOT variable is commented out, telling Xcode to use the default (which is the most recent SDK).
