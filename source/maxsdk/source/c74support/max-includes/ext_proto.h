					Here's an example of sending a list of three numbers. 
	@code
	t_atom myList[3];

					comprised of local (automatic) variables. If the list is small, as in the 
					above example, there's no problem. If your object will regularly send

					initialization time and store the result in a global variable to save the 
					(significant) overhead of calling gensym() every time you want to send a

					Also, do not send lists using outlet_anything() with list as

	@remark	binbuf_vinsert() works somewhat like a printf() for Binbufs. It 
	allows you to pass a number of arguments of different types and insert 
	them into a Binbuf. The entire message will then be terminated with a 
	semicolon. Only 16 items can be passed to binbuf_vinsert(). 
	
	The example below shows the implementation of a normal object's 
	save method. The save method requires that you build a message that 
	begins with #N (the new object) , followed by the name of your object 
	(in this case, represented by the #t_symbol myobject), followed by any 
	arguments your instance creation function requires. In this example, 
	we save the values of two fields m_val1 and m_val2 defined as longs.

	@code
	#N myobject 10 20; 
	#P newobj 218 82 30 myobject; 
	@endcode
	
	The first line will result in a new myobject object to be created; the 
	creation function receives the arguments 10 and 20. The second line 
	contains the text of the object box. The newobj message to a patcher 
	creates the object box user interface object and attaches it to the 
	previously created myobject object. Normally, the newex message is 
	used. This causes the object to be created using the arguments that

 The C-string should be allocated with a size of at least #MAX_FILENAME_CHARS.
 @param	volptr	Receives the Path ID of the file the user wants to open.
 @param	typeptr	The file type of the file the user wants to open.
 @param	types	A list of file types to display. This is not limited to 4 
 types as in the SFGetFile() trap. Pass NULL to display all types.
 @param	ntypes	The number of file types in typelist. Pass 0 to display all types.
 
 @return			0 if the user clicked Open in the dialog box.  
 If the user cancelled, open_dialog() returns a non-zero value.

/**
 Present the user with the standard save file dialog.
 
 The mapping of extensions to types is configured in the C74:/init/max-fileformats.txt file.
 The standard types to use for Max files are 'maxb' for old-format binary files, 
 'TEXT' for text files, and 'JSON' for newer format patchers or other .json files.

 @param	filename	A C-string containing a default name for the file to save.
 If the user decides to save a file, its name is returned here.
 The C-string should be allocated with a size of at least #MAX_FILENAME_CHARS.
 
 @param	path		If the user decides to save the file, the Path ID of the location chosen is returned here.
 
 @param	binptr		Pass NULL for this parameter.  
 This parameter was used in Max 4 to allow the choice of saving binary or text format patchers.
 
 @return				0 if the user choose to save the file.  
 If the user cancelled, returns a non-zero value.

/**
 Present the user with the standard save file dialog with your own list of file types.
 
 saveasdialog_extended() is similar to saveas_dialog(), but allows the 
 additional feature of specifying a list of possible types. These will be 
 displayed in a pop-up menu. 
 
 File types found in the typelist argument that match known Max types 
 will be displayed with descriptive text. Unmatched types will simply 
 display the type name (for example, "foXx" is not a standard type so it 
 would be shown in the pop-up menu as foXx) 
 
 Known file types include:
 - TEXT: text file 
 - maxb: Max binary patcher 
 - maxc: Max collective 
 - Midi: MIDI file 
 - Sd2f: Sound Designer II audio file 
 - NxTS: NeXT/Sun audio file 
 - WAVE: WAVE audio file. 
 - AIFF: AIFF audio file
 - mP3f: Max preference file 
 - PICT: PICT graphic file 
 - MooV: Quicktime movie file 
 - aPcs: VST plug-in 
 - AFxP: VST effect patch data file 
 - AFxB: VST effect bank data file 
 - DATA: Raw data audio file 
 - ULAW: NeXT/Sun audio file
